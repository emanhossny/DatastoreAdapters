A. Description
****************
The NoSQL datastore generic APIs provide a set of generic methods which can be used to develop
generic datastore applications. These applications can be deployed remotely on PaaS clouds 
with no change in the source code. The user needs only to configure the class path of the generic
application to use a specific adapter.

A Semi-Automatic Adapter Validation and Generation (SAVG) module has been designed to semi-automatically validate and generate specific adapters for a generic API.

So, The SAVG module has been used to generated adapters of the NoSQL datastore generic APIs for both 
GAE and Windows Azure.

This application provides the GAE and Azure adapters ofor the NoSQL datastore generic APIs.
